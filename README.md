# Customer_Segementation_Multiple_Distance_Measures
## 1. Project Overview

This project is about Customer Segmentation, which means dividing customers into different groups based on their behavior, characteristics, or purchasing patterns. The project helps businesses understand their customers better and make data-driven decisions for marketing and customer service.

## 2. Aim of the Project

The main aim of this project is to:

Identify different groups of customers

Analyze customer behavior using data

Help businesses target customers more effectively

Improve customer satisfaction and business growth

## 3. Project Description

In this project, customer data is collected and analyzed using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Based on factors such as age, income, spending habits, or purchase history, customers are grouped into segments. Clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) are used to form meaningful customer groups.

## 4. What We Do in This Project

In this project, we:

Collect and load customer data

Clean and preprocess the data

Analyze customer features

Apply clustering techniques

Visualize customer segments

Interpret the results

## 5. Why This Project Is Done

This project is done to:

Understand customer behavior

Improve marketing strategies

Identify high-value customers

Reduce business risk

Increase sales and customer retention

## 6. Final Conclusions

The Customer Segmentation project was successfully completed. Customers were divided into meaningful groups based on their behavior and characteristics. The results can help businesses make better decisions, target customers efficiently, and improve overall performance.

## 7. What We Understand / Learned from This Project

From this project, we understood:

How customer data can be analyzed

The importance of data preprocessing

How clustering algorithms work

The role of data visualization

Practical application of machine learning concepts

## 8. Weak Points of the Project (Limitations)

The weak points or limitations of this project are:

Results depend on data quality

Limited features may affect accuracy

Clustering results may vary with different algorithms

Not suitable for real-time predictions

Can be improved with larger and more diverse datasets
